I am a third-year student at University of California, Davis, pursuing B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with a minor in Economics. I am passionate about software engineering, data analytics, cybersecurity, music composition/production and the world of Web3/DeFi and startups.

Currently, I'm building <a href="https://twitter.com/bostonlobster99/status/1692446325349237245" target="_blank">this project</a> for <a href="https://buildspace.so/" target="_blank">Buildspace S4</a>, and working on my next album.

<!-- I'm originally from Seoul, South Korea where I lived for 12 years before moving to Ottawa, Canada in 6th grade. I then moved again, to the United States, and began high school in Irvine, California. I'm now in Davis/Sacramento area for college. -->
