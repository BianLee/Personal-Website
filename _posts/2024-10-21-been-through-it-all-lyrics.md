(bian!)

<br/><br/>
mirror mirror on the wall<br/>
will u catch me when i fall?<br/>
cuz i dont wanna waste no time again<br/>
we could be more than just friends<br/>
baby we been thru it all<br/><br/>

ive seen all your scars<br/>
i know that u have seen mine<br/>
if tomorrow we depart<br/>
will u stay with me tonight<br/>
are we just playing our part<br/>
need u the rest of my life<br/>
the tension rips me apart<br/>
u see right thru my disguise<br/>
(see right thru my disguise, see right thru my disguise)<br/><br/>

is it wrong of me if its u i hold on?<br/>
I dont wanna hear no sad song<br/>
and i dont wanna have to move on<br/><br/>
