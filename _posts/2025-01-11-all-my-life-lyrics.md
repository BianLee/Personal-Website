<br/><br/>
i wanna stay by ur side <3 <br/>
for as long as im alive<br/>
i wanna stay by ur side<br/>
for as long u would like<br/>
ill get ur pain to subside<br/>
ill hold u thru the night<br/>
ill give u all my time<br/>
u give me peace of mind<br/><br/>

we both know that this love thing aint a one way street<br/>
hold you close if its one thing its just u & me :0<br/>
im ur home thats the one thing ill always be<br/>
hope u know ur all I see â€˜fore I fall asleep<br/><br/>

my mind is occupied<br/>
by u all the time<br/>
the way u think and lie<br/>
the way we intertwine<br/>
for u ill always try<br/>
i wont leave u to dry<br/>
without u ill just die<br/>
ill need u all my life<br/><br/>

(all my life, i need u all my life)<br/>
x4<br/><br/>

i wanna stay by ur side <3<br/>
for as long as im alive<br/>
i wanna stay by ur side<br/>
for as long u would like<br/>
ill get ur pain to subside<br/>
ill hold u thru the night<br/>
ill give u all my time<br/>
u give me peace of mind<br/>
