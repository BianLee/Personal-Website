<b>Resurgence</b>: For the first time since June 2022, Bitcoin has breached the $28,000 mark, registering a remarkable 70% year-to-date (YTD) gain. Other cryptocurrencies have also experienced growth, with Ethereum up by 52% YTD and Binance Coin by 39% YTD. This resurgence can be attributed to two primary events: the recent banking crises and concerns of hyperinflation.

<b>Bank Failures</b>: The banking sector has witnessed four major failures this year alone: Silvergate, Signature Bank, Credit Suisse, and Silicon Valley Bank. Although Silvergate had strong connections with the cryptocurrency sector, its failure did not serve as a negative catalyst for cryptocurrencies. A senior technical analyst at stockcharts.com posited that the news should be viewed positively. Consequently, Bitcoin's price remained relatively stable at around $23,000 without any significant fluctuations. The collapse of traditional banks has reinforced the value of cryptocurrencies as public trust in centralized financial institutions dwindles.

Bank runs, which rarely occur at large banks, can trigger a domino effect. When individuals observe a bank failure, they may withdraw their funds from their own bank, leading to a subsequent bank run. This chain reaction was exemplified by Signature Bank's downfall, which resulted from Silicon Valley Bank's collapse and led to clients withdrawing over $10 billion in deposits. In the past, gold has served as a store of value during financial crises; however, cryptocurrencies are now more accessible. Over the past week, gold prices increased by 7.4% while Bitcoin's value surged by 36.55%.

<b>Inflation</b>: In addition to banking crises, inflation plays a significant role in the current economic climate. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4% last month, as anticipated. Nonetheless, several analysts contend that the reported figures do not accurately represent the economy's actual state, with some even predicting hyperinflation. Former Coinbase CTO Balaji S. Srinivasan wagered $2 million that Bitcoin would surpass $1 million within 90 days due to the ongoing banking crisis and the subsequent "hyperbitcoinization," where Bitcoin replaces gold. Despite the audacious nature of this bet, his assessment of global inflation and the bullish trajectory of cryptocurrencies is likely accurate.

<b>Around the World</b>: Argentina's annual inflation rate exceeded 100% in February, causing the value of the Argentine Peso to halve in just one year. During a period when Bitcoin lost over 30% against the US Dollar, Argentinians witnessed a 20% appreciation against their currency. Similar to Argentina, many developing countries face weak financial systems and hyperinflation, prompting them to accumulate cryptocurrencies. As long as cryptocurrencies outperform their native currencies, the demand will continue to rise.

In times of uncertainty, cryptocurrencies thrive. Centralized banks and government-backed fiat currencies may appear reliable until proven otherwise. The immutable, decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies may be their sole intrinsic value, but it is also their most precious attribute.
