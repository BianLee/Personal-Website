Over my crypto journey I've had many different tokens staked (and unstaked) and here are some things I learned. When doing research into which cryptocurrencies to stake, consider these:

1. <b>Inflationary vs Deflationary tokenomics</b>: Inflationary asset refers to crypto without maximum supply limit. These tokens are continuously being mined and will likely decline in purchase power with new tokens constantly being introduced (the price of asset would theoretically depreciate over time). Deflationary tokens, on the other hand, have cap on supply limit or a "burn" mechanism that takes out certain amounts of tokens out of circulation. This will in theory lead to increase in value of each individual token.

2. <b>APR</b>: APR obviously matters because it's the actual % of return, but high APR doesn't necessarily correlate to bigger profit, due to the matters of inflationary vs deflationary tokenomics. Inflationary tokens typically have high APR in incentive to compensate for losses in inflation, while deflationary tokens are the opposite. Example: ATOM is inflationary and has ~19% APR, while ETH is deflationary and has 5% APR.

3. <b>Staking period</b>: To get the best APR, knowing when to restake matters. When you claim rewards and restake too frequently, you lose out from gas fees incurred at every transaction. On the other hand, if you restake too seldomly, you are letting the rewards sit out and you're missing out on potential returns from staking that amount. You need to find the most optimal time for restaking.

4. <b>Right timing</b>: This one's weird, but I saw this happen with PancakeSwap's CAKE token. When they first opened up the option to stake CAKE for a whole year (locked) with crazy high APR, lot of people jumped at this opportunity. After exactly one year, everyone was trying to realize gains and cash out once their tokens unlocked. With everyone trying to sell and make profit, CAKE price crashed pretty hard and some unlucky people were left with lots of tokens with little value.
